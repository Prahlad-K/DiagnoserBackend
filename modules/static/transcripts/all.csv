125,305,yeah,
126,305,what are some things that make you really mad, traffic <laughter> uh ignorance uh being disrespected uh being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful toward you or other people um that's about it
127,305,okay, dishonesty
128,305,when was the last time that happened, pardon me
129,305,when was the last time that happened , uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh you know or i if i'm riding my bike uh people tend to almost run me over so if i'm not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes
130,305,mm, you know having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that
131,305,yeah,
132,305,that sucks, yeah big time
133,305,what do you do when you're annoyed, what do i do when i'm annoyed
134,305,mhm, um probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times it's i'm myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis   and if i wasn't paying attention i'd be up shit creek
135,305,wow,
136,305,yeah,
137,305,how hard is that, uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions
138,305,yeah,
139,305,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh  um i'm pretty honest with i'm open and honest about any anything and everything
140,305,mhm, and uh what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just you know didn't like that at all
141,305,yeah,
142,305,how did you feel in that moment, pardon me
143,305,how did you feel in that moment, um i'm trying to i'm missing the word for it uh just that i don't know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest  um i don't like i said i don't hold back and i'm pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so
144,305,mhm, you know and if you're lying about something well you just you're always having to cover up uh more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship
145,305,i'm sorry to hear that, can't do nothing about it
146,305,what are some things you like to do for fun, uh fun i like going to the beach uh i love shooting darts but i haven't done it in a while i i love i love to paint uh i got into watercolor painting  and i'm pretty gifted at that and um uh i wanna try some other mediums and uh let's see here i love fishing uh haven't gone in a while though and uh i like driving a truck you know uh it's you know my job you know i was a i really really enjoyed it i don't like driving through cities but uh usually when i'm in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like star gazing i'll see if i can um pick out some of those uh astronomy uh stars up up there and um  i'm a pretty easy going guy so shooting pool um sunshine just those i like
147,305,that's great,
148,305,what's one of your most memorable experiences, uh most memorable experiences um good or bad
149,305,whatever comes to your mind, uh most memorable experiences uh probably uh playing with lions and tigers uh uh wrestling a a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle uh
150,305,oh my gosh, uh just enjoying myself
151,305,awesome, i know
152,305,how close are you to your family, not uh i don't have much family as it is uh at least here in the states i don't my mom's from central america so uh  but i'm not close to i have uh  three brothers one sister and i'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings i speak with one brother uh quite a bit um my other youngest brother you know he he just i'd just rather not  you know i converse <con> converse with him but it's you know just i try to keep it on a professional basis my sister i don't talk to at all my my other brother underneath me i haven't spoken to him in years so i'm just close with my mom uh my niece some of my nephews and that's about it
153,305,okay could you have done anything to avoid it, have i done anything to avoid it
154,305,yes, um to avoid them
155,305,yes, uh yeah i just don't talk to them i don't call them i don't ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know that's on them and i really don't wanna deal with them so
156,305,i see what you mean,
157,305,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh going on a year um you know i uh depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um so just wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts  so  or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over so
158,305,yeah, i don't lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired
159,305,mhm,
160,305,do you feel that way often, uh lately i have been probably about the last few months
161,305,what are you like when you don't sleep well, um tired <laughter> um i you know if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work um and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head
162,305,mhm, and so you know um i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me and uh so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about you know um money um you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that 
163,305,mm,
164,305,how do you cope with them, how do i what
165,305,how do you cope with them, how do i cope with them um i just try not to think about it uh it's it's not about whether coping with it or not um i just do it's uh i'm more of a guy that just you know it may take me a moment to to um say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews
166,305,mm, uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um back to basics you know i just don't let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me
167,305,yeah,
168,305,has that gotten you in trouble, if what has gotten me in trouble my mood swing i mean
169,305,yeah, um yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh  on uh how to interview how to uh how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who  who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done 
170,305,mhm, uh i've done uh i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and  and try to uh work on the issues that were bothering me so um you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school and uh anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities 
171,305,mhm,
172,305,that's good,
173,305,do you feel like therapy is useful, pardon me
174,305,do you feel like therapy is useful, i still didn't hear you
175,305,do you feel like therapy is useful, that people have been deceitful can you repeat that one more time
176,305,why don't we talk about that later, alright
177,305,have you been diagnosed with depression, uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism
178,305,how hard is that, um it's tough if you don't you know um i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms  and i just you know
179,305,mhm, um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and  and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um you know some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and so i just try to cope with things uh um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it   um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still  uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just
180,305,yeah, and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so um but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um
181,305,mm, but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way 
182,305,yeah, so i just let it go i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad 
183,305,i understand,
184,305,did you think you had a problem before you found out, did i have a problem before i got out
185,305,did you think you had a problem before you found out, uh well i  i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people  um i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um  a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago  uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older kind of uh you know makes it work you know
186,305,yeah, me me dealing with life so
187,305,how has seeing a therapist affected you, pardon me
188,305,how has seeing a therapist affected you, uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while uh recently and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um a lot of people may not understand that but uh a therapist is i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh people you know uh uh other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know
189,305,right, but it's good to have
190,305,that's so good to hear, yeah
191,305,what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy, well i don't go anymore uh so um i kinda miss it you know like i said uh uh i miss it a lot actually but uh it's just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will
192,305,why did you stop, um well monetary reasons and uh you know uh i don't have health insurance there's a lot of things that you know i'd like to do but i can't you know um

381,314,that's good,
382,314,where are you from originally, los angeles california here
383,314,really, mhm one of the few um native born los angelinos
384,314,[laughter],
385,314,yeah,
386,314,what do you do now, i uh home school my ten year old son and uh i'm a home maker i have five children and married twenty two years
387,314,wow, mhm
388,314,do you travel a lot, so that's a full time job huh
389,314,do you travel a lot, uh somewhat we can we went to israel about two months ago um for a pilgrimmage with our church yeah so i would say yes i've traveled a bit
390,314,i'd love to hear about one of your trips, uh well most recently we like two months ago went to israel for a pilgrimmage we were gone about nine days and it was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in chorazine which is near the uh galilee and in a place called uh uh i mean the the name of the area is chorazine but uh we stayed in a place called adonis galilea which is a um a house for that welcomes um christian uh pilgrims as well as jewish pilgrims
391,314,that's so good to hear,
392,314,what do you enjoy about traveling, um i i enjoy like really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history i mean especially israel i mean it's the  it's totally ancient but um most most i enjoy is is the the people i think to uh get a better understanding of how different cultures um live
393,314,okay,
394,314,do you consider yourself an introvert, no not at all
395,314,why, just don't i you know all my life i've always been open and and uh willing to socialize and i remember my younger brother always um joking and saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody just because i enjoy learning about other people
396,314,that's good,
397,314,what do you do to relax, um most of the time like by the end of the day after i've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family um i there's a word game on the computer that i like to play for a little while and then um watch t_v have a cocktail with my husband and just relax that's what we do and you know 'cause we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so i like to watch crime dramas
398,314,nice,
399,314,what are some things that make you really mad, um really mad probably not a lot um i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but um in terms of like really um getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like little things that my children do to you know especially my oldest child who's twenty one you know he can be confrontational so other than that nothing gets me like really angry haven't i haven't haven't felt that
400,314,okay,
401,314,what's the best thing about being a parent, um contributing to society helping uh helping to raise um responsible people i guess um and of course the love and the affection and the um the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go i mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults so it's really fun because we're able to um talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have have uh challenging discussions and that sort of thing so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff
402,314,uh huh,
403,314,what's the hardest thing about being a parent, the hardest thing is that it's twenty four seven um you're never not a parent you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first with my first child um thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you you cannot um change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but i mean under normal circumstances you can't change um that and it's a permanent thing and um it it it uh in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom
404,314,i see what you mean,
405,314,there are always tradeoffs in life aren't there, mhm always
406,314,who's someone that's been a positive influence in  your life, i'm sorry i didn't get what you said
407,314,what are some things you like to do for fun who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life , um some of the things that've been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church um and my faith uh but also my husband he's been a really um he's kind of he's very like logical thinking and very you know grounded so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always we balance each other out likewise if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him out it's been a that's been a a great gift in my life
408,314,how are you at controlling your temper, um i don't i i don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a a temper um occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like rarely do i have outbursts um i'm more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up so with you know like my husband and i don't rarely fight like have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because i i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up
409,314,that's good,
410,314,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, um usually i'm arguing with my older son because he um you know he thinks he knows everything he's twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality  and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and you know as life goes on he'll learn more he's very confident and very self uh self uh what's the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct and he still has a lot of learning to do that's all
411,314,that sounds really hard, mhm it is it can be mhm
412,314,what do you think of today's kids, i think um that many of them are um spoiled and live in an environment of uh of instant gratification um which i think is gonna be um detrimental to the to the future of this country but um you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so i i have um hope that um they will i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics and uh hopefully our our the next generation and the the generations after that can maintain that um that standard of living i don't know if it's possible
413,314,yeah,
414,314,how would your best friend describe you, mm as loving nurturing um funny we laugh a lot and um caring honest things that uh i mean my best i have  well actually my best friend is it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um we i for some years took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so um i'm considered the fourth sister so i would say that those are my best friends and and um we love each other very much it's a good relationship
415,314,aw,
416,314,have you ever served in the military, no
417,314,have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, no
418,314,have you been diagnosed with depression, yes most
419,314,how long ago were you diagnosed, mostly mm minorly depression it was more anxiety um probably um um it's probably been five or six years i mean i've had if off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with the anxiety but
420,314,mhm, um other than that i i you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control um but now it's under control so i have a great
421,314,are they triggered by something, huh
422,314,are they triggered by something, um no i think it was what they call free [flee] float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic um reason for it in other words there there was a chemical imbalance 
423,314,oh, in my brain
424,314,how have you been feeling lately, i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um we had a  good family gatherings a little stressed because um we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we're in the throws of that and um so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their eighties so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them
425,314,i understand,
426,314,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep, um not easy usually all of my life i think i've always i mean i'm not i've always had um at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night
427,314,why, um to go to the bathroom basically
428,314,oh, and uh other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning then i can't go back to sleep  i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep idepends on what my schedule is and if the kids are have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors
429,314,that sucks, yeah sometimes it does
430,314,what are you like when you don't sleep well, mm probably basically the same i think i might complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but um i think overall probably the same my kids know i'll be i'll tell me kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful
431,314,okay, they my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so you know they may pitch in a little bit more
432,314,uh huh,
433,314,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately, uh not really not not no not really not anything significant
434,314,do you feel like therapy is useful, huh
435,314,do you feel like therapy is useful, um actually yes i do i do feel like therapy is useful
436,314,tell me more about that, um well uh we had a situation with my daughter um she also suffers from anxiety and um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish a group with her that was a six month um uh group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a  it's the first time they it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers and um it's been really good it's been very helpful it's just all about how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental um strategies to keep your uh keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so um that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter and it's been really um really informational and really helpful i think
437,314,that's so good to hear,
438,314,what got you to seek help, oh my daughter was um she was in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and we knew it and um we acted on it that's all
439,314,that's great,
440,314,when was the last time you felt really happy, um like really joyful and happy i would say probably when probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan
441,314,aw,  uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful um and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day flew to israel so it was right at the same time it was beautiful
442,314,wow, very meaningful and other than that i would say you know like uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday turned eighty three on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so
443,314,what are some things that usually put you in a good mood, um um that's an interesting question i would say um once i get like things done that i need to do like if i'm have a lot of chores [ch] a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once i get them done i feel like a sense of accomplishment you know much like i mean i worked for many years in a as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a and um you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or if there's a lot of different things you have to meet deadlines there's uh that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know so i think that would be you know for me the most um most recent um way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished
444,314,mhm,
445,314,what's your dream job, dream job hm i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula and um
446,314,really, yeah and um so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in the birth the bringing of new life into this world so i would say that's probably was my was a dream job and i didn't know it i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed but um i like i said i do it for family members
447,314,what made you decide to do that, um i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children and um i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends and her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery
448,314,uh huh, but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood um about fifteen years ago 'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old so um yeah and i've been
449,314,how hard is that, um well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but uh and you know also like for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the um the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter]  it was in the middle of the night she was like 
450,314,wow, two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter] so um
451,314,[laughter], it went really fast but other than that you know um yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do
452,314,what's one of your most memorable experiences, um in all of life or in your job
453,314,whatever comes to your mind, uh probably my my own birth i mean my the birth of my own children
454,314,how did you feel in that moment, um like there's an extreme sense of joy excitement relief because of course you're out of the pain and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome after you give birth
455,314,that sounds like a great situation, and i have experienced both ways i've done both um natural and my last child was via c_section so i've had both both um experiences
456,314,mhm,
457,314,is there anything you regret, um i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny
458,314,[laughter], and um she she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water and oof my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because i only had like two contractions after that
459,314,oh no, my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but um i'm sure they weren't happy to fill out a lot of paper work after that
460,314,yeah, so
461,314,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago, now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago um ten or twenty years ago i was probably more not as um relaxed not as um like i feel now at my age that um i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what you know you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things
462,314,that makes sense, what are you most proud of in your life most proud of um probably my family my my husband and my my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've we're an in tact family that um my kids see every day how their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and they um they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so i would say that's probably it
463,314,that's great,
464,314,what would you say are some of your best qualities, um probably the one of my best qualities is uh being able to listen to people and being able to um not be judgmental um through the years i've had a  a lot of experience with um people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and it's just taught me that um everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and um i don't think i'm better than someone else if you think you're better than someone else then that's usually um to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough
465,314,yeah,

1264,341,how are you at controlling your temper, i'm okay i mean i'm pretty easygoing  for the most part i don't really have a temper per se things frustrate me more than they anger me
1265,341,uh huh,
1266,341,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about, xxx oh that's easy <laughter> with my mother she's like um i guess the argument stemmed from me wanting to socialize <laughter> she feels that i'm married with children so i should stay at home like ninety nine percent of the time and i wanted to go out and socialize with some ex co-workers
1267,341,mhm, and she basically kinda put me down for it as if i don't spend enough time with my children <laughter> 
1268,341,that sucks, it does and i love my mom i hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her because i always think gosh i don't wanna get mad at her and then something happens to her the next day but

1274,341,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life, my mom i know it's good and bad <laughter> i mean for the most part my mom's been a positive influence you know it's just sometimes you know she gets a little like she wants to re-raise me or something like she doesn't understand that i'm an adult i'm gonna make my own decisions now and  pretty much have to let me do what i need to do
1275,341,yeah,

1285,341,mhm,
1286,341,how did serving in the military change you, it made me a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that you know did not join the military i can notice a big difference as far as you know how i live my life and how they live theirs
1287,341,uh huh, um just made me a little bit more responsible
1288,341,that's good, thank you <laughter>
1289,341,what did you do after the military, i worked in the medical field for about five years and uh
